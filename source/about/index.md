> Love is patient, love is kind.
> It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not pround.
> It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking,
> it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.
> Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.
> It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.
> Love never fails.
> 
> 1 Corinthians 13:4-8
